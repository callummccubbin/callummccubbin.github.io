            Hello!
            <br><br>
            My name is Callum McCubbin, and I'm a sophomore at the University of Washington studying Applied Physics.
            I'm interested in all sorts of technical problems in STEM, but particularly using code to understand the world we live in
            and create unique user experiences. Here are some of my coding projects.

                    Momentum redirect is a short platforming video game developed using C# in the Unity Engine. It is a solo project, all assets and code being created by me.
                    <br><br>
                    During summer 2020, I wanted to begin a larger project that I would see through to completion. Before, I had started making games in unity and testing out the different tools that it had to offer, but I had never attempted to develop a full product to completion, doing all the requisite steps required. I thus decided to begin work on what would become Momentum Redirect.
                    <br><br>
                    During the development of this game, I learned a lot about the exploratory process of development. Beginning with coding a simple movement system, then testing for what mechanics would be fun to explore as a player, then planning levels around those mechanics, then implementing all of the surrounding architecture, and finally iteratively improving using playtesters. 
                    <br><br>
                    A Github page with the sprites and scripts used in the project is available <a href="https://github.com/callummccubbin/Momentum-Redirect"> here</a>.

                    This name generator is a tool which takes an input index of words and generates new words by predicting the frequencies which letters appear after each other.
                    <br><br>
                    It began as an excel spreadsheet in 2019; after taking a CS class in early 2020, I ported it into Java. Finally, it has been constructed into the more accessible format of a web page on this site coded in Javascript.

                    This page is an interactive procedural animation which allows the user to control a swarm of aquatic worms using their mouse. There are also a set of sliders which can change the parameters of the animation that can be accessed by clicking anywhere on the screen.

                    Coding this page using JS Canvas was an exploration of how simple code can be used to mimic lifelike movement.

                    Temple gun is an isometric video game developed with <a href="https://dereferencemypointer.github.io/">@DereferenceMyPointer</a>  for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020">GMTK 2020 game jam</a> (the theme: Out of Control) over the course of 2 days. In terms of code, I contributed the camera control, tilemap configuration, and sprite implementation.
                    <br><br>
                    Participating in a game jam is intense, but also fun; going through brainstorming around the theme of the jam, to exploring and experimenting, to design and testing, all in 2 days was great development and teamwork practice.
